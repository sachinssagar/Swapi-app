# Star Wars Characters

## Overview
Star Wars Characters is a web application that allows users to explore characters from the Star Wars universe. It fetches data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and presents it in an interactive and visually appealing way.

## Motivation
This project was developed to demonstrate fetching data from an external API and rendering it dynamically in a React application. It also serves as a learning exercise for building responsive user interfaces and implementing search functionality.

## Features
- Display a list of Star Wars characters with their details
- Search for characters by name
- View details of each character, including their hair color, skin color, gender, and number of vehicles

## Technologies Used
- React
- SWAPI (Star Wars API)
- CSS (for styling)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-wars-characters.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd star-wars-characters`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm start`

## Usage
1. Upon launching the application, you will see a list of Star Wars characters.
2. Use the search bar to filter characters by name.
3. Click on a character card to view more details about that character.
